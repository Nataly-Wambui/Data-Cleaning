**Statewide Distributed Solar Project**

This project focuses on a statewide distributed solar initiative, analyzing data related to solar energy installations across the region. The dataset provides insights into various aspects of the project, including installation locations, energy output, and other relevant metrics.

**Data Cleaning Process**
To ensure the quality and usability of the dataset, several data cleaning steps were undertaken

**Filling Null Values**
Where applicable, null values were filled using appropriate methods to maintain data integrity and prevent loss of information. This included using mean or median values for numerical fields and mode for categorical fields.

**Removing Null Values**
In cases where null values could not be reasonably filled, rows containing these null entries were removed to ensure that analyses are performed on complete data.

**Dropping Duplicates**
Duplicate entries were identified and removed to ensure that each record is unique, thereby preventing skewed analysis results.

**Data Visualization**
After cleaning the dataset, various visualizations were created to illustrate key trends and insights. These visualizations help in understanding the distribution of solar installations and their performance across different regions.

The cleaned dataset is now ready for analysis, providing a solid foundation for further exploration of the statewide distributed solar project. The visualizations created will aid in presenting findings and supporting decision-making processes related to solar energy initiatives.
