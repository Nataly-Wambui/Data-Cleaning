**Statewide Distributed Solar Project**

This project focuses on a statewide distributed solar initiative, analyzing data on regional solar energy installations. The dataset provides insights into various aspects of the project, including installation locations, energy output, and other relevant metrics.

**Data Cleaning Process**
To ensure the quality and usability of the dataset, several data-cleaning steps were undertaken

**Filling Null Values**
Where applicable, null values were filled using appropriate methods to maintain data integrity and prevent information loss. This included using mean or median values for numerical fields and mode for categorical fields.

**Removing Null Values**
In cases where null values could not be reasonably filled, rows containing these null entries were removed to ensure that analyses were performed on complete data.

**Dropping Duplicates**
Duplicate entries were identified and removed to ensure that each record is unique, thereby preventing skewed analysis results.

**Data Visualization**
After cleaning the dataset, various visualizations were created to illustrate key trends and insights. These visualizations help in understanding the distribution of solar installations and their performance across different regions.

The cleaned dataset is now ready for analysis, providing a solid foundation for further exploration of the statewide distributed solar project. The visualizations created will aid in presenting findings and supporting decision-making processes related to solar energy initiatives.

**Handling Missing Values**

Imputation Techniques
Utilized various imputation methods to handle missing values effectively, ensuring minimal data loss and maintaining dataset integrity. Techniques included:
  Mean/Median Imputation - Replaced missing values with the mean or median of the respective feature to preserve data distribution14.
  Multiple Imputation - Employed multiple imputation methods to account for uncertainty and variability in the missing data, enhancing the robustness of the dataset.
  
**Encoding Categorical Variables**

  One-Hot Encoding - Implemented one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables into a binary format, facilitating their use in machine learning algorithms13. This technique helps prevent the model from misinterpreting categorical 
  data as ordinal.
  
**Reducing Cardinality**

  Feature Reduction: Applied techniques to reduce cardinality in categorical variables, optimizing model performance by minimizing overfitting and improving interpretability. This involved grouping infrequent categories into an "Other" 
  category or selecting the most significant categories based on domain knowledge.
  
**Creating New Features**

  Feature Creation - Developed new features based on existing data to enhance predictive power. Examples include:
  Interaction Terms - Created interaction features that capture relationships between variables, improving model accuracy.
  Derived Metrics - Generated new metrics (e.g., Body Mass Index from weight and height) that provide additional insights into the dataset.
